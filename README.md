## 📊 Part A: Property Price Prediction

### Overview
Predicts median house values in California districts using features such as median income, location proximity to the ocean, and more.

### Key Techniques
- Linear Regression (Simple & Multiple)
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
